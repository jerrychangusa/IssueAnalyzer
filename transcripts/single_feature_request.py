Agent: Thank you for contacting SecureNet Support. This is Mike. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hey Mike. I'm John from TechCorp. We've been using your DDoS protection system for a while now, but we're looking to step up our game. Got any new features in the pipeline?

Agent: Hi John, thanks for reaching out. We're always working on improving our system. Could you tell me more about what specific improvements you're looking for?

Customer: Well, we're dealing with more sophisticated attacks lately. Our team was wondering if you guys offer any deep packet inspection capabilities?

Agent: That's a great question, John. Currently, our system does offer packet inspection, but it's more surface-level. We don't have deep packet inspection (DPI) implemented yet. It's definitely something we've been considering though. Are you finding that the current inspection isn't catching everything?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. We're seeing some attacks that are slipping through because they look like normal traffic on the surface. DPI would really help us catch those.

Agent: I completely understand. That's valuable feedback. Deep packet inspection would indeed be a significant upgrade to our traffic analysis capabilities. I'll make sure to log this as a feature request for our development team.

Customer: Perfect. Any idea when we might see this feature?

Agent: I wish I could give you a specific timeline, but as this is a feature request, I can't make any promises. What I can do is mark this as a high-priority request from a valuable customer. Our development team takes these requests seriously when planning future updates.

Customer: Fair enough. As long as it's on your radar.

Agent: Absolutely. It's definitely on our radar now. Just to confirm, I'll be submitting a feature request for the implementation of deep packet inspection for enhanced traffic analysis. Is there anything else you'd like me to include?

Customer: No, that covers it. Thanks for taking the time to listen, Mike.

Agent: It's my pleasure, John. We really appreciate this kind of feedback. It helps us improve our service. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Nope, that's all for now. Cheers!

Agent: Alright then. Thanks for choosing SecureNet, John. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day!
