TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Welcome to SecureNet Support. This is Alex. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Alex. We're experiencing a minor issue with our DDoS protection setup.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the issue you're facing?

Customer: Sure. The dashboard is showing incorrect timestamps for some events.

Agent: I see. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Can you tell me more about what you're observing with the timestamps?

Customer: Well, it seems that some of the event logs are showing times that don't match up with when we know the events occurred. It's throwing off our analysis.

Agent: I understand how that could be problematic. This sounds like it might be related to a timezone synchronization issue. Can you confirm which timezone your account is set to?

Customer: We're set to EST.

Agent: Thank you for confirming that. Based on what you're describing, it does appear to be a minor bug in our system. We actually have a patch scheduled for release next week that should address this timezone synchronization issue.

Customer: Oh, that's good to hear. Is there anything we can do in the meantime?

Agent: Yes, there is. As a temporary workaround, you can manually adjust the timezone in your account settings. This should help align the timestamps correctly until the patch is released. Would you like me to guide you through that process?

Customer: No, that's okay. I think we can manage that on our own. It's good to know a fix is coming soon.

Agent: Absolutely. We appreciate your patience and understanding. Is there anything else about the DDoS protection system you'd like to discuss or any other issues you're facing?

Customer: No, that was the only issue we were experiencing. Everything else seems to be working fine.

Agent: I'm glad to hear that. If you do encounter any other issues or have any questions about our DDoS protection features, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Thanks for your help, Alex.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing SecureNet. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, goodbye.
