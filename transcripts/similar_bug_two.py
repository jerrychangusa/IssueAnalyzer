TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Welcome to SecureNet Support. This is Alex. How may I help you today?

Customer: Hey Alex. We've been using your system for a while now, and we're having some serious issues with the alert system. It's not respecting our configured thresholds.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you elaborate on the problem you're experiencing?

Customer: Sure. We've set custom alert thresholds for different types of events, but the system is ignoring them completely. For example, we set it to alert us only if there are more than 100 port scans in a 5-minute period from the same source, but we're getting alerted for every single scan.

Agent: I see. That's definitely not how our system should be functioning. When did you set these custom thresholds?

Customer: We set them up about two weeks ago. Since then, we've been getting thousands of alerts daily. It's so bad that our security team is starting to ignore them, which defeats the purpose of having alerts in the first place.

Agent: I completely understand your concern, and I apologize for this malfunction. This sounds like a serious bug in our alert threshold implementation. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Customer: Well, I'm glad you recognize it's a bug. We were worried that the system just didn't support custom thresholds at all.

Agent: No, custom thresholds are definitely a feature of our system. The fact that they're not being applied is a critical issue. I'm going to file a high-priority bug report right away.

Customer: Good. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible. It's making the entire system unreliable for us.

Agent: I absolutely agree. I assure you that our development team will prioritize this bug. In the meantime, would you like me to work with our technical team to see if we can implement a temporary workaround for your account?

Customer: Yes, please. We need some relief from this flood of alerts.

Agent: Understood. I'll get on that right away and keep you updated on both the temporary fix and the progress of the bug resolution. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for taking this seriously, Alex.

Agent: You're welcome. We appreciate you reporting this issue. It's crucial feedback that helps us improve our service. I'll be in touch soon with updates. Have a great day!
