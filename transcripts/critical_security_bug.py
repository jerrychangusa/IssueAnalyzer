TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Thank you for contacting SecureNet Emergency Support. This is Sarah. How can I assist you?

Customer: Sarah, this is urgent. We've discovered a critical security flaw in the DDoS protection system.

Agent: I understand the urgency. Can you please provide your security clearance code so I can access your account details?

Customer: Of course. It's SN-EMERG-9876.

Agent: Thank you, I've verified your credentials. Please describe the security flaw you've discovered.

Customer: We've found that during a DDoS attack, if the traffic volume exceeds a certain threshold, the system fails open instead of failing closed. This means it's letting all traffic through, including potentially malicious requests.

Agent: This is indeed a critical issue. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm escalating this to our senior security team right now. Can you tell me when you first noticed this behavior?

Customer: We discovered it during a penetration test about an hour ago.

Agent: I see. I've alerted our security team, and they're beginning work on an emergency patch immediately. In the meantime, we need to implement some urgent measures. We're going to need to temporarily lower the traffic threshold on your account to prevent this issue. This may result in some false positives, but it will ensure security until we can roll out a fix.

Customer: Understood. How long do you think it will take to get a proper fix?

Agent: Our team is treating this with the highest priority. We estimate having a patch ready within the next 4-6 hours. We'll need to test it thoroughly before rolling it out to ensure it doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities.

Customer: Alright. Please keep us updated on the progress.

Agent: Absolutely. We'll send you real-time updates as we work on this. Again, I apologize for this serious issue. Is there anything else you need assistance with regarding this matter?

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for the quick response.

Agent: You're welcome. We'll be in touch very soon with updates."""
