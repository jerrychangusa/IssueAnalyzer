TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Thank you for contacting SecureNet Support. This is Henry. How can I help you?

Customer 2: Hello Henry. We're struggling to keep up with the volume of potentially malicious IPs hitting our network. Our team is overwhelmed trying to manually check and update our blocklists.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're facing this challenge. Can you tell me more about your current process for identifying and blocking these IPs?

Customer 2: We're using your allow and denylists, but we have to manually cross-reference IPs with various threat intelligence feeds. It's not sustainable with the volume we're seeing.

Agent: I understand. That does sound like a time-consuming process. How many IPs are you typically dealing with on a daily basis?

Customer 2: We're seeing hundreds of suspicious IPs every day. It's impossible to keep up manually.

Agent: That is indeed a significant volume. I can see why manual processing would be challenging. While our current system doesn't automatically cross-reference with external threat databases, I appreciate you sharing this pain point. It helps us understand where our customers need more support.

Customer 2: Is there any way to integrate external threat feeds directly into your system? That would save us a lot of time and improve our response to threats.

Agent: Currently, we don't have that capability, but I can certainly see how valuable that would be. I'll make sure to relay this feedback to our product team. They're always interested in hearing about ways to improve our service. In the meantime, is there anything we can do to help streamline your current process?

Customer 2: Not really. We just need a way to automate this process. It's becoming a real bottleneck for us.

Agent: I understand. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We take this kind of feedback seriously when considering future improvements to our platform. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer 2: No, that's all. Thanks for listening, Henry.

Agent: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further assistance. Have a great day!
