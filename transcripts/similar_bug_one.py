TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Thank you for contacting SecureNet Support. This is Emma. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Emma. I'm calling because we're getting overwhelmed with alerts from your system. It seems like the alert thresholds aren't working correctly.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the types of alerts you're receiving and how many you're getting on average?

Customer: We're mainly getting alerts for failed login attempts. We're seeing hundreds per day, even though we've set the threshold to 50 failed attempts from the same IP within an hour.

Agent: I see. That definitely sounds like an issue with our alert system. Can you confirm when you set this threshold?

Customer: We set it about a week ago, but it doesn't seem to be having any effect. We're still getting alerted for every single failure.

Agent: Thank you for that information. This is certainly not how our system is supposed to function. It appears there's a bug in our alert threshold implementation. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.

Customer: I appreciate your acknowledgment. This flood of alerts is making the system almost unusable for us.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm going to file a bug report right away about the alert thresholds not being applied correctly. Our development team will prioritize this issue.

Customer: That's good to hear. Do you have any idea when this might be fixed?

Agent: While I can't provide an exact timeline, I assure you that bugs affecting core functionality like this are treated with high priority. In the meantime, I can work with our technical team to see if we can implement a temporary fix for your account.

Customer: That would be helpful. Thank you, Emma.

Agent: You're welcome. I'll keep you updated on the progress of the bug fix. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for taking this seriously.

Agent: Of course. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve our service. Have a great day!
