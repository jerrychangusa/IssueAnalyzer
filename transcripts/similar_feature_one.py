TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Welcome to SecureNet Support. This is Grace. How may I assist you today?

Customer 1: Hi Grace. We're seeing an increase in suspicious traffic from IPs that aren't on any of our lists. Is there a way to automatically check these against known threat databases?

Agent: I understand your concern. Currently, our system allows you to manually update your allow and denylists based on your own threat intelligence. However, I can see how an automated solution would be valuable. Can you tell me more about the challenges you're facing with the current system?

Customer 1: Well, it's becoming extremely time-consuming to manually check and update our lists. We're missing some threats because we can't update fast enough. It would be game-changing if the system could do this automatically.

Agent: I see. That does sound like a significant challenge. You're right, an automated system would be a major improvement. While we don't have this feature at the moment, I believe it's something we should seriously consider adding. How often are you currently updating your lists?

Customer 1: We're doing it daily, but even that doesn't feel frequent enough with how quickly new threats are emerging. In an ideal world, it would be real-time or at least hourly.

Agent: Thank you for sharing that. This is exactly the kind of feedback we need to drive our product development. An automated, real-time threat database integration would indeed be a valuable feature. I'm going to submit this as a formal feature request to our product team. They prioritize enhancements that address critical customer needs like this.

Customer 1: That's great to hear. This feature would really improve our security posture and I imagine it would benefit many of your other customers too.

Agent: Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. This kind of automation aligns perfectly with our goal of providing top-tier security solutions. I'll make sure to emphasize the potential impact and urgency in my feature request. Is there anything else you'd like me to include in the request?

Customer 1: No, I think you've captured the main points. Just please stress how much time and risk this feature would save us.

Agent: I certainly will. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Your input is invaluable in shaping our product roadmap. I'll submit this feature request right after our call, and while I can't promise when or if it will be implemented, I can assure you it will be carefully considered.

Customer 1: That's all I can ask for. Thank you for taking this seriously, Grace.

Agent: You're welcome. We truly appreciate customers like you who help us improve our services. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer 1: No, that's all. Thank you again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for your valuable feedback. Have a great day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other suggestions or concerns!
