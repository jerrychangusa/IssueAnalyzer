TRANSCRIPT = """Agent: Welcome to SecureNet Support. This is Jason. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Jason. I'm new to your system and I'm trying to set up some advanced security features. Can you guide me through this?

Agent: Absolutely! I'd be more than happy to help you explore our advanced security features. Our system is designed to be comprehensive and user-friendly. What specific features were you interested in setting up?

Customer: Well, I was hoping to set up multi-factor authentication, configure some custom alert rules, and maybe implement some automated responses to potential threats.

Agent: Excellent choices! You'll be pleased to know that all of those features are readily available in our current system. Let's go through them one by one. Shall we start with multi-factor authentication?

Customer: Yes, that sounds great.

Agent: Perfect. Navigate to the 'Security Settings' tab in your dashboard. You'll see an option for 'Multi-Factor Authentication'. Click on that, and you'll have choices for SMS, email, or app-based authentication. Which would you prefer?

Customer: Let's go with app-based.

Agent: Excellent choice. Select 'App-based MFA' and follow the on-screen instructions to set it up with your preferred authenticator app. It's a straightforward process, but let me know if you need any clarification.

Customer: No, that's clear. I've got it set up now. That was easy!

Agent: I'm glad to hear that! Now, for custom alert rules, go to the 'Alerts' section. Here, you can create highly customized rules based on various triggers like failed login attempts, unusual traffic patterns, or specific IP ranges.

Customer: Oh, I see. There are so many options here. Can I set different alert thresholds for different types of events?

Agent: Absolutely! That's one of the key features of our alert system. You can set different thresholds for each type of event, and even customize the alert method - email, SMS, or push notification to our mobile app.

Customer: That's fantastic. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Agent: I'm thrilled to hear that. Lastly, for automated responses, check out our 'Automated Security Responses' feature under the 'Advanced' tab. Here, you can set up actions like automatically blocking an IP after a certain number of failed login attempts, or initiating a security scan if suspicious activity is detected.

Customer: Wow, this is comprehensive. I'm impressed by how much customization is possible.

Agent: Thank you! We've worked hard to ensure our system can meet a wide range of security needs without requiring any additional features or modifications. Is there anything else you'd like to set up or explore?

Customer: No, this covers everything I wanted and more. I'm really pleased with how complete and user-friendly your system is.

Agent: That's wonderful to hear! We strive to provide a complete security solution that meets all our customers' needs out of the box. If you ever have any questions about using these features, our support team is always here to help.

Customer: Thank you, Jason. You've been incredibly helpful. I'm looking forward to using these features.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could assist you in discovering these powerful features. Enjoy using SecureNet, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, goodbye!
